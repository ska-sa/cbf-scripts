This document describes the interface internal to the CBF, between
the CMC and the CORR package

The CMC launches a CORR instance on a per subarray, later per instrument
basis. The CORR instance should accept a config file and port as parameters,
as illustrated in the stub 

The config file is a CORR config file, with individual roach boards replaced
by placeholder names ROACH0, ROACH1, ... ROACHn and input ports named similarly
INPUT0, INPUT1, ... INPUTm

The port should be interpreted as a TCP/IP4 network port on which the corr
package listens for KATCP requests. The requests are a subset of those
defined in the ICD, in particular related to the subordinate intefaces. The
list can be found in the stub/ directory - the stub code is trivial and
can be inspected for the list
