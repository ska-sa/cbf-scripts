This document describes the interface internal to the CBF, between
the CMC and the CORR package

The CMC launches a CORR instance on a per subarray/per instrument
basis (this is fuzzy, interface likely to change). The launched CORR 
instance should accept a config file and port as parameters, as illustrated 
in the stub. Somewhat bad deficiency of the template format as it doesn't
accept # comments - will try to remedy that

The config file is a CORR config file, with individual roach boards replaced
by placeholder names ROACH0, ROACH1, ... ROACHn and input ports named similarly
INPUT0, INPUT1, ... INPUTm. At the time of writing these input fields are expected
to sets of multicast address, using a slightly custom format

The port should be interpreted as a TCP/IP4 network port on which the corr
package listens for KATCP requests. The requests are a subset of those
defined in the ICD, in particular related to the subordinate intefaces. The
list can be found in the stub/ directory - the stub code is trivial and
can be inspected for the list
