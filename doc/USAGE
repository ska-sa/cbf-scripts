- telnet to the primary port

  issue a 

    ?resource-list

  request to see the roaches it knows about. Then mark the roaches
  you are willing to use as up

    ?resource-mark roach020826 up
    ?resource-mark roach02080F up

    ...

  Then create a subarray. Currently we handle the rts array in a
  special manner - it shows up at a fixed location

    ?array-assign rts M001 M003

  If this succeeeds, there should now be a suboridnate port

- telnet to the subordinate port

  activate the instrument that you wish to use - this will launch corr
  and replace the null commands with ones fielded by the particular corr
  instance

    ?instrument-activate rts
