The CMC package relies on the C KATCP package to do most of the
heavy lifting in order to to keep as much in common between the 
CMC, DMC and maybe TMC. 

The CMC personality is a kcs server customisation with minor shell 
augmentation:

  cmc-start   
  cmc-stop        - setup and shutdown routines - startup defines
                    commands and variables inside to the katcp server
                    and launches the set of interfaces

  cmc-primary     - code to service the CMC primary requests, and also
                    a few subordinate requests where resource management
                    is shared across arrays and instruments

  cmc-config      - script to generate a CORR config file from a 
                    matching template, uses the C macro preprocessor

  cmc-subordinate - currently mainly unused subordinate handler (most of
                    the work is done by CORR) - may be needed to aggregate
                    responses from multiple instruments in future

  cmc-null        - empty placeholder to field requests 
                    when no instrument has been defined
