You will require the katcp package - at least

  kcs, kcplog, kcprun, kcpmpx, kcpcmd and kcpmsg

in your path, with all the experimenal duplex stuff enabled

For the stub you will also need linetd-1.4

Installation involves a 

  make install 
  
as root from the top-level directory

Note that the make install will not clobber your existing 
/etc/cmc.conf settings - it will show you a diff of the items
it has preserved, if new items get added to the sample config
these will have to be copied across manually

The config file just contains a set of variables (note no space 
between = and its fields). 

The "state=" key field will control how fussy the system is, 
enable debug features, etc.

The command cmc-start should launch the controller, cmc-stop will
shut it down. 

New linux systems have new but rubbish init replacements, there
might be some tricks needed to add the startup script into
that infrastructure

If the CMC is run as root it will drop to nobody, thus the 
corr config directory (/etc/corr) should be writable, maybe use
the sticky bit
